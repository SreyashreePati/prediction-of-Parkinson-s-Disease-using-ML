"This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of Parkinson's disease, leveraging various clinical and physiological features. The objective is to create a predictive system that analyzes data such as voice recordings, tremor assessments, motor function tests, and demographic information to identify patterns indicative of Parkinson's disease. The process involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. By evaluating the model's performance, the project seeks to enhance early diagnosis, enabling timely intervention and better patient management. Ultimately, this analysis aims to contribute to the medical community's understanding of Parkinson's disease and improve patient outcomes through data-driven insights."

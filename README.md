"This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of Parkinson's disease, leveraging various clinical and physiological features. The objective is to create a predictive system that analyzes data such as voice recordings, tremor assessments, motor function tests, and demographic information to identify patterns indicative of Parkinson's disease. The process involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. By evaluating the model's performance, the project seeks to enhance early diagnosis, enabling timely intervention and better patient management. Ultimately, this analysis aims to contribute to the medical community's understanding of Parkinson's disease and improve patient outcomes through data-driven insights."
Detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Using Machine Learning
1. Introduction
Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, causing symptoms such as tremors, muscle stiffness, and speech difficulties. Early detection is crucial for managing symptoms effectively. This project aims to predict Parkinsonâ€™s disease using machine learning techniques based on clinical and vocal features.

2. Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to develop a highly accurate model that can predict whether a person has Parkinsonâ€™s disease based on medical and voice-related features.

Dataset Used: The dataset includes clinical records of individuals with and without Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
Goal: Build a classification model to accurately diagnose Parkinsonâ€™s disease using machine learning.
3. Data Preprocessing
To ensure the dataset was clean and optimized for machine learning models, the following preprocessing steps were performed:

Handling Missing Values: Removed any missing or inconsistent data.
Normalization: Scaled numerical features to bring them into a uniform range.
Feature Selection: Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis to reduce dimensionality.
Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing for evaluation.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain insights into the dataset, the following visualizations were used:

Distribution Plots: Identified patterns and outliers in numerical features.
Boxplots: Highlighted feature variability and potential anomalies.
Pairplots: Showed relationships between different variables.
Heatmap: Displayed feature correlations to aid in feature selection and dimensionality reduction.
5. Machine Learning Models Used
Several classification algorithms were implemented to find the best-performing model:

Logistic Regression

Simple, interpretable, and effective for binary classification.
Works best when relationships between variables are linear.
Random Forest (Best Performing Model)

An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees.
Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy by averaging predictions.
Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Uses hyperplanes to classify data points effectively.
Applied Kernel Trick (RBF Kernel) to handle non-linear data.
Bagging and Stacking Techniques

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Used to combine multiple models and reduce variance.
Stacking: Integrated multiple base models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest) to improve predictions.
6. Model Performance Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score:

Training Set Results:
Achieved 100% accuracy, meaning the model perfectly classified all instances.
Test Set Results:
Also showed 100% accuracy, suggesting a highly effective model.
However, further testing on real-world data is necessary to confirm generalizability.

7. Conclusion & Best Performing Model
Among all models tested, Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, providing high accuracy, robustness, and resistance to overfitting.

ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways:
âœ… Machine learning can effectively predict Parkinsonâ€™s disease using voice-based features.
âœ… Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression and SVM due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data.
âœ… The model showed high accuracy but requires further real-world validation.

8. Future Improvements
To enhance the modelâ€™s performance and applicability, the following steps are recommended:

Hyperparameter Tuning

Use Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model parameters.
Deep Learning Implementation

Apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on voice spectrograms for improved feature extraction.
Larger and More Diverse Dataset

Increase dataset size to improve generalization and reduce bias.
